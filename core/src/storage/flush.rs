/// Types that are able to flush their state into the contract storage.
///
/// # Note
///
/// Many types support caching of their state into memory to avoid costly
/// contract storage reads or writes. When execution of a contract is finished
/// or interrupted (e.g. due to calling a remote contract) we have to flush
/// all cached state into the contract storage.
///
/// # Implementation Hints
///
/// Caching types provided by pDSL are `SyncCell` for caching of a single data
/// and `SyncChunk` for caching an array of data.
///
/// All abstractions built upon them that do not have their own caching mechanism
/// shall simply forward flushing to their interiors. Examples for this are
/// `storage::Vec` or `storage::Value`.
pub trait Flush {
    /// Flushes the cached state back to the contract storage, if any.
    fn flush(&mut self);
}
